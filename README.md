# Clue Web Interface

This project is under development and no release has been issued yet!


Clue web interface is designed to become the default web interface for Clue MCPi media player (Kodi fork for RPi that wasn't yet released) but it could be used also as a standalone web interface for Kodi and XBMC v13.

Clue web interface has been developed using Bootstrap and jQuery libraries, so it could be used on desktops and mobile devices browsers. Communication with Kodi/XBMC/MCPi application has been implemented over JSON (using standard Kodi API), and the web interface is able to provide all necessary functions and functionalities to control the media player.
