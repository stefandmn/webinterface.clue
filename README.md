# Clue WebInterface for Kodi

_**This project is under development and all releases that have been issued are 
only for testing purposes!**_

**Clue WebInterface** package is designed to become the default web interface 
for **Clue** and _Kodi_ mediacenter but also can be used as a standalone 
addon for any _Kodi_ instance.

**Clue WebInterface** has been developed using Bootstrap and jQuery, 
so it might be used on desktops and also mobile device browsers. 
Communication with Kodi application has been implemented over Kodi JSON API. 
The web interface has to provide all necessary functions and functionalities 
to control the media player and all attached libraries.

Development, testing and deployment activities are driven by CCM process (Clue 
Configuration Management), built over GNU `make` utility. To see all make rules
try `make help`.

_Enjoy!_
